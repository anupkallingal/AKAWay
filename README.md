==========
A repository to store all my experimental and research projects. 

Plan to maintain the following structure at the root of this repository:
* projects
* research
* experiments

The Projects folder would have one sub-folder for each project. Each project may have one sub-folder for each of its components.

The Research folder would have one sub-folder for each research type topic e.g. Algorithms, DesignPatterns etc
